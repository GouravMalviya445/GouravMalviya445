# Welcome to my GitHub! üëã
## Hi there üëã

### About me :
I am a student studying at the Modi Institute of Management & Technology. From very early on in my life, I started to fall in love with technology. This love has helped me develop an excellent technological mindset, and given me the curiosity to learn more. I firmly believe that **no amount of knowledge is enough knowledge**. üß†

## What I know :
- **Programming **
	- Python 
	- C
	- Some Java
- **Frontend Development**
	- HTML, CSS and Javascript :white_check_mark:
	- Tailwind CSS
	- React

## What I want to do next :thinking:
- Backend Development (to become a Full-Stack developer)
- At least delve into AI and ML.
